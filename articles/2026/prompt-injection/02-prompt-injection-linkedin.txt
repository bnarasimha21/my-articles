Prompt Injection Is a Real Risk When Running AI Agents

We built OpenClaw so anyone can run long-running AI agents. Research, cron jobs, multi-step workflows that run for hours.

Every web search, every tool call, every page the agent reads is a potential injection surface. A single compromised website can plant instructions the agent blindly follows.

Many people run OpenClaw on personal machines like Mac minis. If you understand security policies and know what to enable, that setup unlocks a lot more. 
But if you would rather not take that risk and still want to explore what agents can do, running in a sandboxed cloud environment is a great option. Isolated containers, small blast radius, and you can still do a lot.

Either way, know the risks. I wrote a deeper breakdown of the attack surface and mitigations. Link in comments.
